# LMtoolbox

LMtoolbox is an collection of CLI tools using language models designed to modernize your workflow in the terminal. Built using OpenAI's ChatGPT, the tools in this toolbox can generate automatic commit messages, perform dictionary and thesaurus queries, translate text, proofread content, enrich language learning, and automate shell commands, among others. Obviously, you can also interact with ChatGPT directly.

## Prompt Templates 

For those less experienced with terminal interfaces or those preferring the convenience of a web interface, the [ChatGPT web interface templates](https://github.com/sderev/lmtoolbox/tree/main/prompt-templates) in the LMtoolbox can prove incredibly useful. These templates offer a broad spectrum of pre-structured prompts designed to enhance your engagement with ChatGPT, particularly in the context of longer chat interactions with GPT-4 in order to avoid expensive API costs.

These templates, found in the [`prompt-templates/`](https://github.com/sderev/lmtoolbox/tree/main/prompt-templates) directory, cater to various situations and are an excellent resource if you're uncertain about structuring prompts or seek to improve the effectiveness of your existing ones.

## Installation

### pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install lmtoolbox
```

### `pipx`, the Easy Way

```bash
pipx install lmtoolbox
```

## Getting Started

### Configuring your OpenAI API key

For LMtoolbox to work properly, it is necessary to acquire and configure an OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to accomplish this:

1. **Acquire the OpenAI API key**: You can do this by creating an account on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once registered, you will have access to your unique API key.

2. **Set usage limit**: Before you start using the API, you need to define a usage limit. You can configure this in your OpenAI account settings by navigating to *Billing -> Usage limits*.

3. **Configure the OpenAI API key**: Once you have your API key, you can set it up by running the `lmt key set` command.

    ```bash
    lmt key set
    ```

With these steps, you should now have successfully set up your OpenAI API key, ready for use with the LMtoolbox

## Tools

Instructions on how to use each of the tools are included in the individual directories under [tools/](https://github.com/sderev/lmtoolbox/tree/main/tools). This is also where I give some tricks and tips on their usage ðŸ’¡ðŸ‘€ðŸ’­.

Note that LMterminal (`lmt`) is the main tool in the LMtoolbox. All of its options apply to (almost) all of the other tools. For instance, you change the model to GPT-4o with `-m 4o` or add emojis with `--emoji`. Refer to the [LMterminal's documentation](https://github.com/sderev/lmterminal) for more information. 

* **Reading from `stdin`**: Almost all of the tools can read from `stdin`. For instance: `cat my_text.md | summarize`.

* **Output Redirection**: You can use output redirections with the tools. For instance: `cat my_text.md | critique --raw > critique_of_my_text.md`

Here's a brief overview of the tools:

### LMterminal (`lmt`)

[LMterminal](https://github.com/sderev/lmterminal) (`lmt`) empowers you to interact directly with ChatGPT from the comfort of your terminal. One of the core features of `lmt` is its ability to facilitate the creation of custom templates, enabling you to design your personalized toolbox of CLI applications.
